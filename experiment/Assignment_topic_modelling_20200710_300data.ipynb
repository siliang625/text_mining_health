cancer, the most common tumor in women in Mali and worldwide has been linked to several risk factors, including genetic factors, such as the PIN3 16-bp duplication polymorphism of TP53. The aim of our study was to evaluate the role of the PIN3 16-bp duplication polymorphism in the susceptibility to breast cancer in the Malian population and to perform a meta-analysis to better understand the correlation with data from other populations.\\n\\n\\nMethods\\nWe analyzed the PIN3 16-bp duplication polymorphism in blood samples of 60 Malian women with breast cancer and 60 healthy Malian women using PCR. In addition, we performed a meta-analysis of case-control study data from international databases, including Pubmed, Harvard University Library, Genetics Medical Literature Database, Genesis Library and Web of Science. Overall, odds ratio (OR) with 95% CI from fixed and random effects models were determined. Inconsistency was used to assess heterogeneity between studies and publication bias was estimated using the funnel plot.\\n\\n\\nResults\\nIn the studied Malian patients, a significant association of PIN3 16-bp duplication polymorphism with breast cancer risk was observed in dominant (A1A2\\u2009+\\u2009A2A2 vs. A1A1: OR\\u2009=\\u20092.26, CI 95%\\u2009=\\u20091.08–4.73; P\\u2009=\\u20090.02) and additive (A2 vs. A1: OR\\u2009=\\u20091.87, CI 95%\\u2009=\\u20091.05–3.33; P\\u2009=\\u20090.03) models, but not in the recessive model (P\\u2009=\\u20090.38). In the meta-analysis, nineteen (19) articles were included with a total of 6018 disease cases and 4456 controls. Except for the dominant model (P\\u2009=\\u20090.15), an increased risk of breast cancer was detected with the recessive (OR\\u2009=\\u20091.46, 95% CI\\u2009=\\u20091.15–1.85; P\\u2009=\\u20090.002) and additive (OR\\u2009=\\u20091.11, 95% CI\\u2009=\\u20091.02–1.19; P\\u2009=\\u20090.01) models.\\n\\n\\nConclusion\\nThe case-control study showed that PIN3 16-bp duplication polymorphism of TP53 is a significant risk factor for breast cancer in Malian women. These findings are supported by data from the meta-analysis carried out on different ethnic groups around the world.\\n\\n'"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":11}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"XdMNz2RDq771","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":34},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1594324499684,"user_tz":360,"elapsed":126707,"user":{"displayName":"Celine
